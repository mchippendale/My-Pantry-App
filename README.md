[APP Link - Please sign up](https://guarded-journey-01402.herokuapp.com/)

## Summary 

The class project was to build a functional database backed web application using the Sinatra App. The app includes 2 resources to store user data and pantry item data. The app needed to include sign up/log in functionality(if they make sense), with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow. Finally the app must have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resource with GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE for read, create, update and delete.
